<p>This chapter will provide an orientation to open science code repositories, via GitHub, so you can find and use code that may be useful to you.</p>
<p>We learned to organize and work through our own projects by observing how others organize theirs. The amazing thing is that you can find hundreds of excellent examples to learn from as even major companies put their code on GitHub.</p>
<!-- Outline

# git and GitHub in practice {#GitHub-in-practice}

-   list of git features/ commands we are assuming familiarity with in a git vs. GitHub comparison
-   foreach {commits, issues, branches, forks & pull requests, rebase}:
    -   (Kelly) define the term/feature: review of the feature, rely on previous workshops/existing doc (as written for ch2)
    -   (Kellly) point to how GitHub works with this, link to GitHub images and docs
    -   (Pat) describe important elements of this feature in practice: principles of using commits, how much code to put into a commit and why ( this helps to understand the language of OSS collaboration )
    -   (Pat) outline a typical workflow for using the feature
        -   this helps to understand the context of the culture of OSS collaboration
        -   real world example

Anatomy of a code base (15 min)** - common elements (cover licensing here in 1 sentence and a link) - our taxonomy - example code bases

**Using that code in your work** (10 minutes) - clonsider the licenceing

**Engaging with issues and PRs** ( 15 mintues ) - demo of that for a README file (Pat/Beth's repo) - demo of that with our own book

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> What is a code base?<a href="GitHub-in-practice.html#what-is-a-code-base" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In this book we may use the terms ârepositoryâ, âproejctâ, or âcode baseâ interchangeably but they have slightly different meanings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>âCode baseâ is a colloquial term for any collection of related to code in one or more files that works together to perform a function, or provide an application.</p></li>
<li><p>A ârepositoryâ is an collection of code managed by git, not necessarily on an external server (i.e., GitHub or others). This could be on your laptop. The database of version history is inside the .git folder, and so that .git folder is the repository (although when people say ârepositoryâ or ârepoâ they are often referring to the combination of the code base and the .git version control). This is also called a âgit repoâ.</p></li>
<li><p>GitHub also calls their units ârepositoriesâ, so in GitHub the URL pattern <code>github.com/&lt;user_name&gt;/&lt;repository_name&gt;</code> contains a git repository (and possibly more than one).</p></li>
<li><p>We may think of projects as the code base plus associated data files, and all of the other stuff needed to complete the research. However, it should be noted that GitHub uses âprojectâ to mean âproject management featuresâ (task tracking, due dates, work progress monitoring) which can be used for one or more repos. A research project may require multiple repos (e.g., one for data entry &amp; cleaning, one for analysis, and one for a website to show it all off) and a GitHub project can tie those together. This is a new feature that we wonât go into much but we will go into the existing project management features that GitHub has for repos (e.g., issue tracking).</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Distributed version control<a href="GitHub-in-practice.html#distributed-version-control" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Version control systems are an answer to the age-old problem of âscript_final.Râ, âscript_submitted_to_Science.Râ, âscript_finaler.Râ, and âscript_final_i_swear_this_is_the_last_one.Râ that tend to clog up and confuse storage space on all of our computers. By tracking changes in a document (in this context, usually a coded script), version control systems allow you to keep a record of all the changes that you have made without having to re-save new documents every time. Version control systems also allow for multiple users to make changes to the same document and keep track of the who-did-what side of things.</p>
<p>Version control systems store all of these changes and iterations in whatâs called a ârepositoryâ (also known as a repo). Think of the repository as the archive that keeps track of all of the changes that youâve made to your work over time. Typically a single repository is created for each unique project, program, package, etc. In the context of scientific research, a new repository is often created to store the code needed for the analyses in an individual manuscript. This way, the repository can be referenced in a publication and readers of your work can look âunder-the-hoodâ of the methods you used. This approach increases the transparency and accuracy of research by allowing others to reproduce your results and identify and possible mistakes.</p>
<p>There are two main types of version control systems: <strong><em>centralized</em></strong> and <strong><em>distributed</em></strong>. The difference lies in where the repository is stored. In a centralized version control system, there is a single computer server that hosts the repository. All the people editing the repository must have access to that server. The downside of centralized version control is that if the server crashes or gets corrupted or decides to take a vacation, your team is in big trouble. In other words, there is little redundancy in a centralized version control system. Distributed version control systems, on the other hand, allow all the contributors create a âcloneâ of the repository that they store on their own computer. They can make changes to this local repository and, if they want to share those changes with others, they can âpushâ them up to a shared repository, often stored in an online-based repository hosting system (see <a href="GitHub-in-practice.html#why-use-github">Why use GitHub?</a> below). In this way, if the cloud based repository decides to up and explode for some unknown reason (or a known reason), there are multiple backup versions on contributorâs local computers that can be used to restore the repo.</p>

<p>Coding has become a nearly ubiquitous part of scientific research, with scientists developing increasingly complex analyses requiring extensive data wrangling and post-analysis processing and visualization steps. The development of the code needed to run these analyses often goes through many iterations during the initial development process through to the final stages of peer review. Using a distributed version control system like Git can help researchers to code collaboratively, manage and organize different versions of the same analysis, and serve as an archive of the methods used to process and analyze research data. These advantages help to support researchers in the pursuit of â<a href="https://www.cos.io/open-science">open science</a>â by increasing transparency while also serving as a useful record that can be referred back to and reproduced in the future.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3</span> Git typical workflow (review)<a href="GitHub-in-practice.html#git-typical-workflow-review" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>This is an extremely simplified description of the components of a basic git workflow, typically covered in introductory git books and workshops. For much more detail see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository">Pro Git, Chapter 2.2</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p><img src="figures/GitWorkflowFig.png" width="65%" style="float:right; padding:10px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Cloning</em></strong>: First get a copy of an existing repository to work on. Cloning is the term used for downloading of a local copy of a remote repository on your computer. This includes all the branches and all of the history of repository. A typical workflow is to clone the repository, modify the code, stage the changes, commit the staged changes, and then push the changes back up to the remote repository. This requires access to, and knowing the URL of, a git <strong>remote</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Editing</strong>: Edit your code on your computer to fix a bug or work on an new feature.</li>
<li><strong><em>Staging</em></strong>: After youâve modified a document, staging allows you to mark the file for inclusion in a future commit. If your terminal is set to the home directory of your repository, the command <code>git add &lt;filename&gt;</code> will allow you to stage changes.</li>
<li><strong><em>Committing</em></strong>: Once a change or group of changes is staged, they can be committed to your local repository. A commit is a way to group a set of changes together under a common theme. Part of the commit is a commit message which allows you to summarize the purpose of the changes you made to the code. More on the anatomy of a good commit message later. <em>Note: You can pick and choose the staged files that you want to be included in each commit.</em></li>
<li><strong><em>Pushing/Pulling</em></strong>: Pushing a commit is the way to incorporate changes from your local repository up to the remote repository. Think of it as pushing your changes up from your computer into the cloud. Conversely, pulling changes is taking changes that others have made to the remote repository and pulling them down from the cloud onto your local version of the repo.</li>

<!-- GitHub is an online-based repository hosting system for Git repositories.  -->
<p>As we will see below, GitHub has many useful features that expand upon git and facilitate communication and collaboration among large groups of coders. <!-- GitHub "Issues" are one such feature that allow users to identify problems or ways to improve a set of code, to assign responsibility for the tasks needed to address them, and to keep track of the changes in the code that were made. --> Additionally, GitHub has features that allow for content generation, including static websites (like this one!) created using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<p>While GitHub can require a bit of a learning curve, we believe that it is well worth the effort and, in the long run, will save researchers a lot of time on trouble-shooting, reproducing results, and sharing analysis.</p>

<p>What are the features of git (independent of GitHub) to use commit messages as communication? This is always covered in an introductory git course, but we summarize them here from the perspective of a communication system:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The set of changes to the code. When we compare these changes to another version of the code, this is known as the â<strong>diff</strong>â (named for the utility that shows the changes).<br />
</li>
<li>The commit message itself.</li>
<li>Option additional summary message.</li>
<li>Other things not directly part of the commit that put the commit in context: the branch itâs in, the fork itâs a part of, and a link to a description of the feature or issue (more on all of those things later).</li>
</ol>
<div id="guidelines-for-using-commits" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.5.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.1</span> Guidelines for using commits<a href="GitHub-in-practice.html#guidelines-for-using-commits" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The central feature of most version control system is the âcommitâ we describe above. nd version control, at itâs heart, is a system for software developers to communicate. Understanding the motivation and context of the âgit commitâ is key to interpreting a code repository.</p>
<p>A git commit and the associate message should communicate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why are these lines of code here? What feature does this bit of code help to implement, or which bug was fixed?</li>
<li>What other code was changed, if any?<br />
</li>
<li>Who made this change so I can ask them for more information if I need to (e.g., to debug or make changes to improve the code base)?</li>
<li>To a limited extent, why is the code structured this way? (Although this is more often described in the code itself.)</li>
<li>If my program incorporates, imports, or otherwise depends on this code, is it affected by this change? That is, I depend on this code base and something has changed that makes my system crash.</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe that approaching commits as communication will drive how you use git, and also help you to collaborate with GitHub.</p>
<p>These are some guidelines that software developers adhere to for using git commit:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Keep the commit focused on a very specific problem to fix or feature to add. Note that features often require many small adjustments or changes and so a feature implementation in code can be a collection of commits. Some use the phrase âatomicâ to describe the changes you make: the smallest amount of change to make a difference, no less and no more.<br />
</li>
<li>Code <em>should</em> still work when committing. That is, donât commit non-working code unless you absolutely have to.<br />
</li>
<li>The git commit message should focus on âwhyâ instead of âwhatâ: the code diff already shows us the what.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some things to emphasize:</p>
<p>A good commit is focused on solving a single problem or making a change that helps to implement a small feature. This way itâs very clear was code was changed or added and why. When we you look over all the changes in a commit, it will be hard to to get a holistic understanding if it includes many changes lines across many files. Exploring git commit logs in GitHub will help you to understand how to use git more effectively. Less is more when it comes to commits.</p>
<p>It takes discipline to make the commits completely atomic. We often think a change is complete, only to find a typo or other problem after the commit is made. Git has mechanisms for dealing with that we will define later.</p>
<p>Git+GitHub is not a backup system. If you want to save all the work youâve done use a real file back-up system, not git. Mac and Windows both have backup systems built-in, and you should use them to make as frequent snapshots or backups as possible. You could also have a copy of your code folder on an external drive.</p>
<p>What if you are given a large set of changes that only halfway implements a bug fix or feature? Would you understand what do to next? That is one reason why commits should be as complete as possible. Sometimes because of how teams agree to work, you may be encouraged to push all of your code so it can be reviewed, even if you are not finished.In that case, devs (aka the coders) often put the acronym â<em>WIP</em>â for â<em>Work in Progress</em>â to indicate the code is not complete, or â<em>untested</em>â to indicate the code is complete but has not been rigorously tested.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.2</span> Examples of ineffective commits:<a href="GitHub-in-practice.html#examples-of-ineffective-commits" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>A change to a few lines in the readme for grammar or other minor edit, with the message â<em>update readme</em>â - this doesnât say why the README was updated!</p></li>
<li><p>A commit that says â<em>daily commit</em>â or â<em>end-of-day commit</em>â tells me nothing about why the code was changed, or how I should start up to complete it if Iâm asked. Again, this appears to be an attempt to use git+GitHub as a backup system. Donât do that.</p></li>
<li><p>git commit message â<em>fix</em>â â fix what?â¦and why?</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.3</span> Effective Commits<a href="GitHub-in-practice.html#effective-commits" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Effective commits can be 1 line of code or hundreds, it really depends on the context and what is being communicated.</p>
<p>One example of a common problem in coding is the âboundary errorâ or the related âoff by oneâ error. For example, if you are checking if a loop is done for a counter that is reduced each time, and you have <code>counter==0</code> but some how the counter can be negative in some cases, the loop will continue! The solution is to change your <code>if</code> condition to <code>counter &lt; 1</code> and a good commit message would â<em>fix boundary error in replication loop</em>â. You donât need to mention the file name - that will be in the diff.</p>
</div>
<div id="real-world-commit-work-flow" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.5.4">

<p>Being disciplined for commits is not easy and the authors frequently donât follow this. Here is an example of a real-world, imperfect workflow:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Adding a feature âadd logistic regression analysisâ</li>
<li>Add code to accomplish this (and data files, parameters, etc)</li>
<li>Quick testing show that is works!</li>
<li>Add changed files and commit âadd log regression for X,Y, Zâ¦â</li>
<li>Test again and find there is a problem!<br />
</li>
<li>Fix the code, and test again</li>
<li>Git add the files and commit âfix missing parameter for logistic regression analysisâ (or something like that)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we have two commits (and hence two diff views) that address different parts of a problem.</p>
<p>Git has some great features for dealing with this that we will cover, and that will make you understand how others get their commit histories to look so clean and perfect! One major solution is to use branching, which we described in detail below. Branching is like telling the sub-plot in a story. Other solutions are âsquashedâ commits and amending commits.</p>

<p>GitHub allows you to add comments to commits. For example, to ask a question of your collaborator who made the commit (<code>@kellykapsar do you think this will break the analysis later?</code>). You can even add comments to a specific line in the code in commit (<code>please help me untangle this insane dplyr command</code>).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> GitHub issue tracking<a href="GitHub-in-practice.html#github-issue-tracking" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Weâve mentioned GitHub issue tracking several times. While isse tracking is not a git feature or necessary to use git, this feature has been a cornerstone of open source collaboration within and outside of software development teams.</p>
<p>The basic concept of an issue and itsâ use is very simple. The second example of a commit above from the CRAWL project has an associated GitHub issue, and we know this because the dev who made the commit added a summary message â<em>longlat or geographic coordinate reference systems are not supported. this adds explicit checks and throws an error if geographic coordinates are provided. Fixes #39</em>â GitHub automatically links the issue ID number to the web page for the issue, which is
<a href="https://github.com/NMML/crawl/issues/39">âadd error catch when <code>sf</code> object is in 4326â</a>. Because the commit states it fixes this issue, we can assume that all the code necessary is in the commit, which you can confirm in the diff.</p>
<p>The issue has the description âif an sf object is passed to crwMLE but with EPSG 4326, the fit will fail. However, no error message indicates this is a problem.â This describes the situation that causes the problem (related to the GIS coordinate reference system) and that when the problem occurs, the program doesnât tell you. This program and problem are very specific to spatial ecology.</p>
<p>Issues add another effective communication tool to commits besides just the commit message and optional summary. They merge project management and version control for more effective collaboration among diverse teams.</p>

<p>GitHub is not the only service to use issue tracking, and there are other, industrial-strength project management tools that can create this link from issue to commit. Many other large open source projects use non-GitHub issue tracking tools (e.g., the Mozilla project), especially those that pre-date GitHub, or donât want to depend on a commercial entity like GitHub.com.<br />
<!-- for example ROpenSci?  Link --></p>
<p>Can you find examples of clearly defined issues and how someone solved the problem in a code base or package that you use?</p>
<p>We should note that when you view the commits on the program on your computer as described above, the issue number has no link since this is only a GitHub thing. There may be an extension or add-on for your programming editor that creates this link to GitHub for you.</p>

<p>Like commits, issues are most effective when they are focused, which is intuitively not unlike a to-do list. Writing âget organizedâ as an item on your to-do list is not very helpful.</p>
<!--- 
GitHub (and other sites like it) have additional (and optional) project management features to organize larger aspects of your project.  These are often tied to 'releases' of software projects which we will discuss later.
--->
<p>A typical workflow for combining GitHub issue tracking and commits is:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Determine a problem to fix, or a feature to add</li>
<li>Create an issue describing that in GitHub and note the issue number</li>
<li>Edit your code to address the issue</li>
<li>As you add and commit files, include the issue number in the commit message or summary.<br />
</li>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Push commits to the remote</li>
<li>Repeat steps above until the issue is fixed</li>
<li>Optionally add comments to the issue if you want to help your collaborators understand your approach, or more things to do</li>
<li>Close the issue</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: This workflow is very appropriate for a project with a single developer. In addition, we mentioned earlier that there are methods for helping you organize or collect multiple commits for better communication. Git branches help both collaboration and communication (see below).</p>

<li>This is a great example of an obtuse issue. There is an R package âMapViewâ this is a 1-stop-mapping thing, super easy. Someone there raised an issue. MapView depends on RLeaflet (I just know this, it doesnât say that anywhere in the issue). The leader of the MapView project realized that it was an RLeaflet problem, so copy/pasted the issue into the RLeaflet project. I say RLeaflet because that project actually heavily depends on the original leaflet.js for javascript, which most people just called âleafletâ. Another interesting thing is that the first commenter (Darcy somebody) says that polygons are fine, which does not need to be said because the OP already said it was ok, but no one piled on and said âhe already said that.â Note the issue was raised in 2015 and no one was assigned and it was not fixed. The issue was reference in 2018 for new issue (created by Rstudio) to fix it, and I only know that because in the new issue they referenced the issue number. but even that one was not fixed. Also, in the original issue is an extensive post to show a work-around. That info now just sits here in a GitHub issue.
<ul>
<li>A question for the group: What should have been done by the project to deal with this issue (Hints: Create an issue to add the work-around in the documentation, when creating a new issue, close the original and reference the new one. Possibly tag it as âwontfixâ or better tag it in a project roadmap to make it clear they care about it and will deal with at some future time.

<p>You can think of branches as a kind of internal copy within your repository. When working on a branch, the files in the main repository are untouched. You can stage changes, make commits, and push/pull to remote within a branch and it wonât affect the main repository. This makes branches very useful when you want to make substantial changes to your repository that youâre not quite sure will work.</p>
<p>Branches are also helpful when collaborating with others. If one person needs to run the main model, but you want to test out tweaking a few things, you can work on a branch while they stay on the main branch. Then, once your confident the changes in your branch are working correctly you can merge them from your branch back into the main repo.</p>
<p>Branches also serve as method for organizing multiple commits together, especially if you are using a branch to address an issue.</p>
<p>A typical workflow with branches is:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create or identify an issue that needs work on.</li>
<li>Create a branch with a short name for that issue, and ideally include the issue number (e.g.Â 39-catch-4326-error if we use the example above).
<ul>
<li>There are several methods and workflows for creating branches locally and on the remote, but thatâs covered in a later workshop.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Checkout the branch.</li>
<li>Edit your code to address the issue and test.</li>
<li>As you add and commit files, include the issue number in the commit message or summary.<br />
</li>
<li>Push commits to the remote branch.</li>
<li>Repeat steps above until the issue is fixed.</li>
<li>Checkout the main branch.</li>
<li>Merge your âfeatue branchâ into main.</li>
<li>Handle merge conflicts if necessary (see below).</li>
</ol>
<p>Some development teams include an issue number in the name of the branches. You shouldnât using the <code>#</code> in the branch name, and GitHub does not automatically link a branch with an issue but this really helps identify what the branch was made for.</p>

<p>A really magical aspect of git is how it can merge two different sets of code without issue so often.</p>
<p>However, âmerge conflictsâ do arise.They are a normal part of the development process when two things are changed near the same place, and it has a special way to deal with them. If a merge conflict happens, git places âconflict marksâ inside your code, and the solution is simply to examine the two changes (incoming = stuff you are merging in) and âcurrentâ or âheadâ (which is the place you started from) and decide which to keep and what to change, and then removing the conflict marks.</p>

<p>There is no magic other than your brain and your code editor. After solving the conflicts in the file, you add the file to the stage (see above) and commit. Then the merge can be completed. GitHub has a</p>

<p>When working on large open source project, itâs a good idea to not let anybody and everybody have immediate edit access to the repository where that project is kept. However, you still want to allow the broader user community to participate and contribute to the project. Forking is one way to address this problem. <strong><em>Forking</em></strong> a repository allows you to create a copy of a given repository (including all of its branches and history!) on your personal GitHub account. When you make changes to a forked repository, the original repository is not affected. However, if you have some changes that you think would help to improve the original project, you can submit a <strong><em>pull request</em></strong> to the owners of the original repository. If they like your change, then they can accept and incorporate (âpullâ) it into the original projectâs repository.</p>
<p>Still confused? <a href="https://toolsqa.com/git/difference-between-git-clone-and-git-fork/">This webpage</a> has a really nice explanation of forking vs.Â cloning, along with helpful diagrams.</p>
