# Exercise: Working with someone else's repo {#exercise}

For this exercise, you are going to use forking, commits, and pull requests to edit somebody else's repo. That somebody else is us - You will be editing this repo. Follow the instructions below to walk through this process.   

## Instructions 
1. Choose from the following options: 
  * Identify a public repository on GitHub that falls into one of the three categories we discussed (package, project, reference).
    * Note: We're especially looking for some more Python-based examples/repositories! 
  * Identify a resource (website, tutorial, youtube video, etc.) that you find useful that relates to the content of this class.
2. Create a fork of this repository (IBEEM-MSU/ibeem-collaborative-coding)
3. Edit the text of the `10-resources.rmd` file to add in your repository/resouce. 
  * Note: You can edit the text directly in GitHub (Click the pencil-shaped "Edit this File" button in the upper right hand corner after you click on the file name.) or you can fork the repository and then clone a copy down to your computer to edit in your preferred integrated development environment (VS Code, RStudio, etc.). 
4. Create a descriptive commit message describing your change (and push to remote if working from a cloned repository). 
5. Navigate back to the main page for the original repo and create a pull request. 
6. Click the link to `compare across forks` at the top of the pull request. 
7. Write a pull request that references your commit (use your commit hash to do so) and submit. 
8. Pat yourself on the back for doing our job for us by generating resources/examples for future workshops!
